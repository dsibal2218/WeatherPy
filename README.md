# WeatherPy

During class module, we created a PlanMytrip app where we created multiple dataframes related to weather data, vacation hotel destination suggestions and we created heat maps utilizing APIs and visualization skills. 

For this challenge, we are to generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data we already gathered during class module, we will use APIs to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

Additionally, we will use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers

Lastly, we are also to use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
